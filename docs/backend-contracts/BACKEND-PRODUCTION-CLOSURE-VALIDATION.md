## Environment evidence

- Windows identity: `laptop-v69h45g8\23328`.
- Docker client/server: 29.6.2; Docker Desktop 4.85.0; Linux Engine; context `default`.
- Docker was invoked by the same identity with an isolated empty configuration directory at `C:\tmp\bnbu-production-closure-docker-config`; no personal Docker credentials were read or copied.
- PostgreSQL test container: `bnbu-production-closure-postgres`, bound to loopback port 55432.
- Runtime image tag: `bnbu-sports-backend:production-closure-d368aea`.
- Migrator image tag: `bnbu-sports-backend-migrator:production-closure-d368aea`.
- The successful runtime container was stopped cleanly after live/ready checks. The dedicated PostgreSQL container remains test-only and contains no real user data.

## Resolved failures observed during implementation

The final results above are clean reruns. Earlier runs exposed and then verified fixes for five missing success-conformance fixtures, one integration fixture-policy violation, one stale unit assertion, one stale contract reference-count assertion, and one runtime smoke setup error caused by generating synthetic keys from the wrong working directory. The first container correctly failed fast for missing required configuration; no production validation was weakened.

## GitHub validation

The authoritative public repository, default branch, and published baseline commit were verified before push. PR URL, remote PR head, workflow runs, and required-check terminal results are filled into the final closure report after hosted validation completes.
